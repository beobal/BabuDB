General
------------

babudb/cpp's build system is based on CMake (http://www.cmake.com). With CMake
you can generate build or project files for your favorite build environment
and platform.

babudb's only dependency, the platform classes of yield are part of the
repository (third_party/yield_platform) and are part of the CMake build files.

CMake exports two targets: a library for linking with your applications and a
unit test executable.
